## Features
 
East West Symphonic Orchestra Silver comes with over 11 GB of samples, covering all the essential orchestral instruments and sections. You can choose from strings, brass, woodwinds, percussion, keyboards, and harp. Each instrument has multiple articulations and expressions, such as legato, staccato, pizzicato, tremolo, trills, portamento, repetition, and more. You can also adjust the volume and pan of each mic position (close, stage, and hall) to create your own custom mix.
 
The plugin runs on the Play engine, which is a powerful and intuitive interface that allows you to access all the controls and settings of the library. You can easily load instruments, change articulations, adjust filters, envelopes, effects, and more. You can also use the intelligent performance section to add realism and variation to your playing. For example, you can use portamento to slide between notes, repetition to play fast runs or ostinatos, legato to play smooth transitions, and round robin reset to avoid machine-gun effect.
 
One of the most impressive features of East West Symphonic Orchestra Silver is the convolution reverb, which uses the actual impulse responses of the hall where the orchestra was recorded. This gives you a natural and authentic ambience that matches the sound of the instruments. You can also adjust the pre-delay and master level of the reverb to suit your taste.
 
## Sounds
 
The sounds of East West Symphonic Orchestra Silver are stunning and realistic. The samples are rich in detail and expression, capturing the nuances and dynamics of each instrument. The sound quality is also very high, thanks to the 16-bit resolution and the high-resolution audio engine. The library covers a wide range of musical styles and genres, from classical to cinematic to pop. You can create anything from delicate solo passages to epic full orchestral arrangements with ease.
 
The instruments are well balanced and blend well together as a whole. The strings are expressive and smooth, the brass are powerful and bright, the woodwinds are warm and agile, the percussion are crisp and punchy, and the keyboards and harp are elegant and versatile. The mic positions also add depth and dimension to the soundstage, allowing you to create different perspectives and moods.
 
## Performance

You can also install each section on multiple computers with a single license (iLok required).
