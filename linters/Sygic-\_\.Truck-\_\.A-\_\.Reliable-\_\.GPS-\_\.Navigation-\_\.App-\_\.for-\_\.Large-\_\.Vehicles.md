## Custom Routing According to Vehicle Parameters
 
One of the most important features of Sygic Truck & Caravan GPS Navigation is that it allows you to customize your routes according to your vehicle type, size, weight, number of trailers, and other settings. You can choose from four vehicle options: Truck, RV/Bus, Van, or Car. You can also set the maximum speed, length, height, weight, width, number of axles, level of Hazmat (general HAZMAT, water pollutants, explosives), and other optional preferences. You can use metric, imperial, or U.S. units.
 
By entering these details, Sygic Truck & Caravan GPS Navigation will calculate the best route for your vehicle and prevent you from running into hazards like low bridges or narrow streets. It will also avoid roads that are not suitable or restricted for your vehicle type or load settings. For example, if you are driving a truck with explosives, it will avoid tunnels or residential areas. If you are driving an RV or a caravan, it will avoid roads with sharp curves or steep gradients.
 
You can also set your route preferences such as avoiding toll roads, ferries, or U-turns. You can also choose to prefer right turns or arrival with the destination on the right side. Sygic Truck & Caravan GPS Navigation will optimize your route according to these preferences and save you time and money.
  
## 3D Offline Maps with Free Map Updates
 
Another great feature of Sygic Truck & Caravan GPS Navigation is that it works reliably even when there is no internet connection.

The offline maps also contain detailed information about truck-related POIs such as petrol stations, truck stops, weigh stations, rest areas, service stations, parking lots, restaurants, or campsites. You can search for addresses and millions of POIs in the offline mode as well.
 
Sygic Truck & Caravan GPS Navigation also provides free map updates multiple times per year. You can download the latest map data for free and always drive with up-to-date maps.
  
## Realtime Traffic and Speed Cameras Warnings
